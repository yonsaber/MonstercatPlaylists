This part of the project is more about actually understanding the calls and responses I need to write in the full app to build out the system. To get this running you will need to get an OAuth token from Twitch, add it into `twitchchat.rb` then run `bundle install` followed by `ruby main.rb`, if all is good then it will start up!
